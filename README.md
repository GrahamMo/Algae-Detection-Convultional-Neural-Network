# Algae-Detection-Convultional-Neural-Network
This project uses a google image web-scrapper to collect a data set of algae blooms and lakes. Then using a simple convolutional neural net it determines if an algal bloom is present in the photo.

The Neural net is mine but the webscrapper is this quick and easy one I would highly recommend.
